# Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)

## intro

- store and retrieve any amount of data.
- stores data as *objects*, which can be anything from large binary files (eg. photos and videos) to text files.
- objects are stored in buckets, these are just equivalent to namespaces.

## features

- can select data at object or bucket level
- S3 Select allows for lower level queries (ie querying inside an object) on objects stored in CSV, JSON, or Apache Parquet format. This uses simple SQL statements
- S3 can pretend to be a web server and allow access to objects directly using HTTPS requests
- not optimised for speed
- supports versioning, ie. can track changes or rollback

## alternatives
