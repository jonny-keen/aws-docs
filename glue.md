# AWS Glue

## intro

- a managed ETL (extract transform load) service which runs in an Apache Spark environment
- limited to Python or Scala based
- recommends and generates code for you, but this can be altered, or completely custome code can be used instead
- can be used for processing and cleaning data

## alternatives

- Amazon Data Pipeline: a lower level version of Glue, with greater control over things like environment, code and resources
- Amazon EMR also uses Spark but gives you direct access to manage low-level processes
